# Noise-Removal-using-WaveUNet
In this project we have trained a machine learning model to remove noise from an audio file. Random noisy file was made by adding random number value to the audio file. To remove the noise we have trained a WaveUNet model and fine-tuned to remove noise from different musical genres' audio files.
